# Star: Optimizing GPT-4 Level Outputs with Better Prompting

## Introduction
Star is an open-source project focused on enhancing GPT-4 level model outputs through optimized prompting techniques. By defining and suggesting structured methodologies, Star aims to improve the user experience, ensuring that responses align with the expectations of experienced users.

The core idea behind Star is that individuals with expertise in various domains can guide AI on how it should respond to queries. This project serves as a platform to refine and implement these optimizations.

## Features
### 1. Teaching Assistant
Currently, Star includes:
- **Concept Explanation Assistant**: Helps in breaking down and explaining concepts effectively.

Planned features:
- **Problem-Solving Expert**: Assists users in solving complex problems through structured and step-by-step responses.

### 2. Education First Approach
We are initially focusing on educational use cases, catering to educators and individuals with limited exposure to LLMs. Support for more technical domains, such as coding assistance, will be gradually introduced.

### 3. Community Contributions
If you are interested in contributing, please feel free to open an issue in the repository. Your feedback and ideas are highly valued!

### 4. Open-Source & Non-Commercial
Star is a fully open-source project and is strictly **prohibited for commercial use**. Further licensing details will be refined and updated in the future.
